# Exercise - 1

## Overview

This exercise demonstrates the implementation of various design patterns categorized into behavioral, creational, and structural patterns within a C# console application. The application includes features for logging significant events, managing user interactions, and showcasing robust task management using design patterns that enhance code maintainability and scalability.

### Behavioral Patterns

#### Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern is implemented to enable a `Student` class to notify registered `Teacher` observers about changes in its state, specifically grade updates. This decouples the student and teachers, allowing for flexible and maintainable interactions.

**Key Components**:
- **IObservable**: Interface that defines methods for registering, unregistering, and notifying observers.
- **IObserver**: Interface for observers to receive updates.
- **Student**: Concrete class that manages the list of observers and sends notifications on grade changes.
- **Teacher**: Concrete observer that receives updates when a studentâ€™s grade changes.

#### Command Pattern

The Command Pattern encapsulates commands as objects, allowing for parameterization of objects with operations. A `ControlPanel` class manages commands to start and stop lectures, improving code organization and reusability.

**Key Components**:
- **ICommand**: Interface for command execution.
- **Lecture**: Class representing a lecture with methods to start and stop it.
- **StartLectureCommand**: Command implementation for starting a lecture.
- **StopLectureCommand**: Command implementation for stopping a lecture.

### Creational Patterns

#### Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method Pattern is used to create instances of different types of courses without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. The `CourseFactory` creates either an `OnlineCourse` or `InPersonCourse` based on user input.

**Key Components**:
- **Course**: Abstract base class defining the course interface.
- **OnlineCourse**: Concrete class representing an online course.
- **InPersonCourse**: Concrete class representing an in-person course.
- **CourseFactory**: Static factory class for creating course instances based on type.

#### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern ensures that there is only one instance of the `CourseCatalog` class, which manages all courses throughout the application. This pattern provides a global point of access to the course catalog.

**Key Components**:
- **CourseCatalog**: Class designed to hold a list of courses and maintain a single instance.

### Structural Patterns

#### Adapter Pattern

The Adapter Pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together, enabling the application to use different payment processors seamlessly. `PayPalAdapter` and `CreditCardAdapter` adapt their respective payment methods to a common interface.

**Key Components**:
- **IPaymentProcessor**: Interface for processing payments.
- **PayPal**: Concrete payment processing class for PayPal.
- **CreditCard**: Concrete payment processing class for credit card payments.
- **PayPalAdapter**: Adapter for integrating PayPal with the payment processor interface.
- **CreditCardAdapter**: Adapter for integrating credit card payments with the payment processor interface.

#### Facade Pattern

The Facade Pattern simplifies interactions with the underlying system. The `CourseEnrollmentFacade` class provides a simplified interface to the complex process of enrolling in a course and processing payments.

**Key Components**:
- **CourseEnrollmentFacade**: A class that unifies the enrollment process and payment processing through a single method.
